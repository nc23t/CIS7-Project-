# CIS7-Project-
This repository is for my CIS7 Project, specifically a Vigenere Cypher Program in C++.
I created this program by myself in Visual Studios and published the program on 12/8/24.
This program's basic function is to encrypt a message given to the console, and then decrypt the same message to demonstrate its operation.
This program cannot encrypt anything other than alphabet letters. 
Input a word into the console and hit enter to see how the program works.
